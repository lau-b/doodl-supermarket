## project structure
- `data`
    - `raw`: place to store all data sources as we get them
    - `processed`: place to store data after we did some wrangling and tranformation
- `notebooks`: place to create and save jupyter notebooks used for exploration of data or trying out some code snippets
- `src`: python code that we run to do all the magic (imagine this folder to be the place for out production code)
